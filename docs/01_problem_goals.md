# Problem & Goals Document - Classic Snake Game

## Game Purpose

The Classic Snake Game is a Unity-based implementation of the iconic arcade game that challenges players to control a growing snake while avoiding collisions. The game serves as both an entertainment application and a demonstration of clean software architecture principles, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) patterns using modern game development practices.

## Player Experience

### Core Gameplay
- **Objective**: Guide a snake to consume apples (*) while avoiding walls and self-collision
- **Growth Mechanism**: Snake length increases by 1 segment after each apple consumed
- **Scoring**: +1 point per apple eaten
- **Progression**: Game becomes more challenging as snake length increases, reducing available space

### User Interface
- **Desktop Application**: Clean Unity-based rendering with real-time updates
- **Visual Elements**: 
  - Snake head: Green circle sprite
  - Snake body: Darker green circle sprites
  - Apples: Red circle sprite
  - Walls: Gray border sprites
- **Information Panel**: UI Canvas displaying score, length, speed, pause/AI status
- **Modern UI**: Professional game interface with smooth animations

### Controls
- **Movement**: Arrow keys or WASD
- **Game Control**: P (pause/resume), Escape (quit)
- **Advanced Features**: U (undo), T (toggle AI)
- **Mouse Support**: Optional mouse controls for menu navigation

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform Support**: Primary target is desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Unity Version**: Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer required
- **C# Version**: C# 9.0+ features supported
- **Graphics Requirements**: Modern graphics card supporting Unity's rendering pipeline

### Performance Constraints
- **Tick Rate**: Must maintain consistent timing (±10ms tolerance)
  - Easy: 200ms/tick (5 FPS)
  - Normal: 125ms/tick (8 FPS) (default)
  - Hard: 80ms/tick (12.5 FPS)
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS rendering with smooth gameplay
- **Memory**: Stable memory usage without leaks during extended play sessions
- **Unity Performance**: Efficient use of Unity's rendering pipeline

### Design Constraints
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between game logic and Unity components
- **Patterns**: Mandatory use of State, Command, Observer, and Strategy patterns
- **Determinism**: Configurable RNG seed for reproducible testing
- **Unity Integration**: Proper use of Unity's component system and lifecycle
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allowing future enhancements

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Tick Timing**: Maintain 125ms/tick (±10ms) on 20×15 board for Normal difficulty
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 60 FPS rendering
- **Consistency**: Stable performance across ≥1,000 ticks
- **Responsiveness**: Input latency <16ms for smooth gameplay
- **Unity Performance**: Efficient rendering with minimal draw calls

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: ≥90% coverage for core game logic modules
- **Code Quality**: Zero linting errors, strict type checking compliance
- **Reliability**: Clean startup/shutdown, proper Unity lifecycle management
- **Unity Standards**: Follow Unity coding standards and best practices

### Functional Metrics
- **Playability**: Complete game loop with all core features working
- **Feature Completeness**: All acceptance criteria met
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Unity Integration**: Proper use of Unity's systems and components

### User Experience Metrics
- **Intuitive Controls**: Immediate response to player input
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between game elements with modern graphics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and exceptions
- **Modern UI**: Professional game interface with smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive controls

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Unity Version Compatibility**: Different Unity versions may have breaking changes
- **Platform-Specific Issues**: Unity builds may behave differently across platforms

### Medium Risk
- **Performance on Low-End Systems**: Unity rendering may be challenging on older hardware
- **Input Handling**: Complex input systems may introduce latency

### Low Risk
- **Game Logic**: Core snake mechanics are well-understood and straightforward
- **Testing**: Deterministic behavior enables comprehensive test coverage
- **Unity Ecosystem**: Mature platform with extensive documentation and community support

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
1. All acceptance criteria from TODO.md are met
2. Performance requirements are consistently maintained
3. Code quality metrics are achieved
4. Documentation is complete and clear
5. Unity project builds and runs on all target platforms
6. Game is fully playable with all features working correctly
7. Professional Unity development practices are followed
8. All design patterns are properly implemented and demonstrated
